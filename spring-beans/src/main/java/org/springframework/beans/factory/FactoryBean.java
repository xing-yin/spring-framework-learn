/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a {@link BeanFactory} which
 * are themselves factories for individual objects. If a bean implements this
 * interface, it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a
 * bean instance that will be exposed itself.
 * <p>
 * 由{@link BeanFactory }中使用的对象实现的接口，这些对象本身就是单个对象的工厂。
 * 如果Bean实现此接口，则它将用作暴露对象的工厂，而不是直接暴露自身作为的Bean实例。
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean.</b>
 * A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean
 * references ({@link #getObject()}) is always the object that it creates.
 * <p>
 * 实现此接口的bean不能用作普通的 bean。FactoryBean定义了bean的样式，
 * 但是暴露 bean 引用对象是始终通过（{@link getObject（）}）方法来创建。
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can either create
 * objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup. The {@link SmartFactoryBean}
 * interface allows for exposing more fine-grained behavioral metadata(细粒度的行为元数据).
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for example for
 * the AOP {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} or the
 * {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}. It can be used for
 * custom components as well; however, this is only common for infrastructure code.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FactoryBean} is a programmatic contract. Implementations are not
 * supposed to rely on annotation-driven injection or other reflective facilities.</b>
 * {@link #getObjectType()} {@link #getObject()} invocations may arrive early in the
 * bootstrap process, even ahead of any post-processor setup. If you need access to
 * other beans, implement {@link BeanFactoryAware} and obtain them programmatically.
 * <p>
 * {@code FactoryBean}是编程约定。实现不应依赖于注释驱动的注入或其他反射性工具。
 * <b> {@link getObjectType（）} {@link getObject（）}调用在启动过程中可能会提前使用，甚至在任何后置处理器设置之前也是如此。
 * <p>
 * 如果您需要访问其他bean，请实现{@link BeanFactoryAware}并以编程方式获取它们。
 *
 * <p><b>The container is only responsible for managing the lifecycle of the FactoryBean
 * instance, not the lifecycle of the objects created by the FactoryBean.</b> Therefore,
 * a destroy method on an exposed bean object (such as {@link java.io.Closeable#close()}
 * will <i>not</i> be called automatically. Instead, a FactoryBean should implement
 * {@link DisposableBean} and delegate any such close call to the underlying object.
 *
 * <p>Finally, FactoryBean objects participate in the containing BeanFactory's
 * synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no need for internal
 * synchronization other than for purposes of lazy initialization within the
 * FactoryBean itself (or the like).
 * <p>
 * 最后，FactoryBean对象参与包含 BeanFactory 的 Bean 创建同步。
 * 除了出于 FactoryBean 自身（或类似方式）内部的延迟初始化的目的之外，通常不需要内部同步。
 * (容器本身保证同步)
